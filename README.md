Homework section 2:

As required in the instruction:

> 6. Use the model `create()` method to insert 3 rows of example data. This logic should happen _after_ the model synchronization completes. The data should persist. Restarting the API should not cause any data to be lost.


Please run `npm run create-example-data` first, and then `npm run start` :)
